            " Hello everyone, I'm Mina and welcome to this presentation on object classification in computer vision. An overview. In this session, we'll go through the foundational concepts, traditional and modern approaches, and future directions of object classification. A key task in computer vision. Let's begin by understanding what object classification is. Object classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the goal is to identify the primary object in an image and assign it to one of the predefined categories. For example, given an image of a cat, the model will classify it under the cat category with a certain confidence score. This task forms the base for many advanced applications like face recognition. Medical diagnosis from images. And more, now let's take a look at how humans and computers perceive images differently. Human vision is incredibly flexible. We can recognize objects even when they're rotated, partially hidden, or under poor lighting, our brains interpret context and patterns intuitively. On the other hand, computers see images as a raise of pixel values. They rely on algorithms to extract features and recognize patterns. That's why object classification in computer vision is such a challenge. It's about replicating human level recognition using data and models. Next, we'll understand how object classification differs from object detection. Object classification identifies the main object in the image, like car or dog. Object detection, however, not only identifies the object but also localizes it in the image using bounding boxes. For example, in a street image, classification would label it as car, while detection would highlight and label each object, like cars, traffic lights, pedestrians, all at once. Let's explore the typical workflow involved in object classification. The process involves four key steps. Image acquisition, capturing or collecting images, pre-processing, enhancing image quality or resizing to standard formats, feature extraction, extracting key details like edges or textures using algorithms, classification, using a model to assign the image to a specific class. We'll now look at the traditional methods used for object classification before deep learning. Became dominant, before deep learning, object classification relied on manual feature extraction methods like SIFT, detects key points and descriptors in images. Hog focuses on edge direction and shape, then models like SVM, decision trees, or K&N were used to classify based on these features. These methods worked well but were limited in handling complex images and large variations. Now, let's see how deep learning revolutionized object classification. Deep learning changed the game. Models like convolutional neural networks or CNNs automatically learn features from raw images. Without manual intervention, this allows much higher accuracy and robustness. Unlike traditional models, CNNs can handle large datasets and variations in lighting, pose, and background. Let's understand how a CNN is structured. CNNs are made up of several layers. Convolutional layers, detect local patterns, pooling layers, reduce dimensions while keeping important features. Fully connected layers, make final decisions for classification. CNNs also use activation functions like RELU and loss functions like cross entropy during training. We now move on to some commonly used datasets in this field. Popular datasets include ImageNet, over 14 million labeled images across 20,000 categories. CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100. Small images in 10 or 100 categories. MNIST, Handwritten digits from 0 to 9. These datasets are used for training and benchmarking object classification models. Next, let's look at how we evaluate the performance of classification models. To measure model performance, we use accuracy, overall correctness, precision and recall, how well it detects relevant objects. F1 score, a balanced average of precision and recall. Confusion matrix helps visualize true versus predicted classifications for all categories. Now let's see some real world applications of object classification. It is used in autonomous vehicles, identifying road signs and objects, healthcare, classifying medical scans like MRIs or X-rays, retail, product recognition and visual search, surveillance, face recognition and thread detection. However, this field comes with its set of challenges. Major challenges include viewpoint variation, different angles or positions, occlusion, part of the object is hidden, lighting conditions, affect image clarity, intraclass variation, same class with very different appearances. All these factors can reduce model accuracy. Let's briefly explore the future directions in this area. New directions include transformer based models like vision transformers or VIT. Few shot learning, learning from very few examples. Multimodal learning, combining images with texture audio. These approaches aim to make models more flexible and intelligent. To wrap up, here's a summary of everything we covered. Object classification helps machines understand images. And it's the foundation for many advanced vision applications. From early handcrafted techniques to deep learning and transformers, the field has evolved rapidly. With better data sets and smarter models, we're moving closer to human level visual understanding. Thank you for listening.\n"

            " Hello everyone, I'm Mina and welcome to this presentation on object classification in computer vision. An overview. In this session, we'll go through the foundational concepts, traditional and modern approaches, and future directions of object classification. A key task in computer vision. Object classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the goal is to identify the primary object in an image and assign it to one of the predefined categories. For example, given an image of a cat, the model will classify it under the cat category with a certain confidence score. This task forms the base for many advanced applications like face recognition, medical diagnosis from images, and more. Human vision is incredibly flexible. We can recognize objects even when they're rotated, partially hidden, or under poor lighting, our brains interpret context and patterns intuitively. On the other hand, computers see images as arrays of pixel values. They rely on algorithms to extract features and recognize patterns. That's why object classification in computer vision is such a challenge. It's about replicating human level recognition using data and models. Object classification identifies the main object in the image, like car, or dog. Object detection, however, not only identifies the object but also localizes it in the image using bounding boxes. For example, in a street image, classification would label it as car, while detection would highlight and label each object, like cars, traffic lights, pedestrians, all at once. The object classification process involves four key steps. Image acquisition, capturing or collecting images, pre-processing, enhancing image quality or resizing to standard formats. Feature extraction, extracting key details like edges or textures using algorithms. Classification, using a model to assign the image to a specific class. Before deep learning, object classification relied on manual feature extraction methods like SIFT, detects key points and descriptors in images. Hog focuses on edge direction and shape. Then models like SVM, decision trees, or K&N were used to classify based on these features. These methods worked well but were limited in handling complex images and large variations. Deep learning changed the game. Models like convolutional neural networks or CNNs automatically learn features from raw images. Without manual intervention, this allows much higher accuracy and robustness. Unlike traditional models, CNNs can handle large data sets and variations in lighting, pose, and background. CNNs are made up of several layers. Convolutional layers, detect local patterns, pooling layers, reduce dimensions while keeping important features. Fully connected layers, make final decisions for classification. CNNs also use activation functions like RELU and loss functions like cross entropy during training. Popular data sets include ImageNet, over 14 million labeled images across 20,000 categories. CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100, small images in 10 or 100 categories. MNIST, handwritten digits from 0 to 9. These data sets are used for training and benchmarking object classification models. To measure model performance, we use accuracy, overall correctness, precision and recall, how well it detects relevant objects. F1 score, a balanced average of precision and recall. Confusion matrix helps visualize true versus predicted classifications for all categories. Object classification is used in autonomous vehicles, identifying road signs and objects. Healthcare, classifying medical scans like MRIs or X-rays. Retail, product recognition and visual search, surveillance, face recognition and threat detection. Major challenges include viewpoint variation, different angles or positions, occlusion, part of the object is hidden, lighting conditions, affect image clarity, intraclass variation, same class with very different appearances. All these factors can reduce model accuracy. New directions include, transformer based models, like vision transformers or VIT. Few shot learning, learning from very few examples. Multimodal learning, combining images with texture audio. These approaches aim to make models more flexible and intelligent. In summary, object classification helps machines understand images. And it's the foundation for many advanced vision applications. From early handcrafted techniques to deep learning and transformers, the field has evolved rapidly. With better data sets and smarter models, we're moving closer to human level visual understanding. Thank you for listening.\n"
